As students we were challenged with reading the Redux documentation to increase our understanding of another package that performs similar functionality while also increasing our exposure to how developers will have to parse through documentation they may be unfamiliar with to resolve an issue in development. It's intended that when reviewing the code behind this project that you'll find a refactored code document that uses Redux to handle state management for the web application.",
