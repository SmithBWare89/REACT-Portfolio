# [REACT Developer Portfolio](https://github.com/SmithBWare89/REACT-Portfolio) -- [Deployed](https://smithbware89.github.io/REACT-Portfolio/)

## Description
This project is intended to be a demonstration of my usage of REACT. I've recreated my original developer portfolio and have added in a carousel that opens into a modal with additional information on each project. I've also added a basic resume to the portfolio as well as links to my Github, Stack Overflow, and LinkedIn accounts.

## User Story
```
AS AN employer looking for candidates with experience building single-page applications
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed React portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
```
